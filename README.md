# ECommerce--v2

This is my second iteration of building an e-commerce platform, crafted with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project is a full-stack application that combines a sleek, user-friendly frontend with a robust backend. The frontend is nearly complete, featuring dynamic product pages, smooth navigation, and essential e-commerce functionalities. The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless shopping experience across all devices, from desktop to mobile.
